# Technical questions to answer

## What are the benefits of using thirdweb Engine?
The ThirdWeb Engine is like a powerhouse for blockchain developers. It helps them handle all the complicated stuff behind the scenes. Here's why it's so handy:

- **Handles Lots of Stuff:** It can do many things at once, like sending transactions across the blockchain without any fuss. So, when your app gets busy, it stays reliable.
- **Fixes Mistakes:** Ever had a transaction get stuck or fail? The Engine can automatically sort out these problems, so you don't have to worry about them.
- **Avoids Doing Things Twice:** It's careful not to repeat actions, so you don't accidentally do something twice, like sending money or creating digital items.
- **Keeps Your Wallets Safe:** It works with your wallets, which you control. Whether you keep them on your computer or use fancy cloud storage, it's your call.
- **Makes Smart Contracts Easy:** If you need to use smart contracts (which are like digital agreements), the Engine makes it easy to do so, without needing to understand all the technical stuff.
- **Pays for Transaction Fees:** You can even cover the fees for your users' transactions. This means they don't need to worry about having money for fees themselves.
- **Hides the Hard Parts:** It hides the tricky bits of blockchain stuff, so your app runs smoothly without needing to know all the details.
- **Notifies You of Important Things:** It's good at letting you know when something important happens in your app, like when a transaction finishes or an event occurs.
